For each activation function, train the model on each dataset ('shakespeare_char', 'enwik8', 'text8') and record the training loss, validation loss, and inference speed.  This requires modifying the `MLP` class to accept a new `activation` parameter and replacing the `self.gelu` call with `self.activation(x)`.  Similarly, `CausalSelfAttention` could be modified to experiment with alternatives to softmax within the attention mechanism. The results will be compared across activation functions and datasets to determine which activation function yields the best performance.",

Train the model multiple times for each dataset, each time with a different dropout configuration.  Compare the training curves, final validation loss, and inference speed across different dropout strategies. Analyze the results to identify the optimal dropout configuration for each dataset.
